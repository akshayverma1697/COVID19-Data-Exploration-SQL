# COVID19-Data-Exploration-SQL

In this project I collected data on covid deaths and covid vaccinations from ourworldindata.org, and extracted the data into a CSV, which you can download, and explored the data using various SQL commands to gather interesting insights. The data was uploaded to SQL Studio, I used Azure Data Studio, but you can use any SQL Server, in order to run these commands. You can download the SQL file and run them as well.
